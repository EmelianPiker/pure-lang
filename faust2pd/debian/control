Description: Generate Pd GUI abstractions from Faust programs
 faust2pd is a little utility to generate "graph-on-parent" GUI abstractions
 from programs written in Faust, Grame's functional signal processing
 language. This makes it easier to use Faust signal processing units with
 Miller Puckette's Pure Data (Pd).

 collection of faust2pd examples.
