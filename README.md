# The Pure Programming Language

Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term
rewriting. It offers equational definitions with pattern matching, full
symbolic rewriting capabilities, dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation,
lexical closures, built-in list and matrix support and an easy-to-use C
interface. The interpreter uses [LLVM][0] as a backend to JIT-compile Pure
programs to fast native code.

Please check our [Github website][1] for more information. The Pure Language
and Library Documentation is available in [html][3] and [pdf][4] format. A
very complete and up-to-date collection of packages for Arch Linux are
available from the [Arch User Repositories][5], please also check
our [Pure on Arch Linux][6] wiki page for details. We also offer a reasonably
complete set of Ubuntu packages at [Launchpad][7]. Instructions for installing
Pure on the Mac and Windows can be found on the [Pure on Mac OS X][6b]
and [Pure on Windows][6c] wiki pages. Source packages can be found on
the [Download][2] page. Please also have a look at our [mailing list][8] /
Google group and [IRC chat][9] (#pure-lang on freenode) if you need any help
or if you want to discuss Pure.

Please also check my [personal Github site][10] for some fun side projects
that I've written in or for Pure (mostly about computer music and multimedia).
